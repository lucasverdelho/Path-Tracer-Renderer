This project was developed for Visualização e Iluminação (Visualization and Lighting) class at Universidade do Minho. The main goal of this project is to implement a modular rendering engine in C++ following the teachings of the Physically Based Rendering: From theory to implementation book by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob and Greg Humphreys. This has been my most insightful project into the rendering world, where I've learned about the theory behind the rendering process of which I was already familiarized with most concepts due to previous experience in Blender.


TODO:
- [x] Clean up the comments and fix variable names etc
- [x] THE ORTHOGONAL CAMERA IS CALCULATING THE COORDINATES IN A WEIRD WAY AND THE X IS INVERTED (POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES I THINK)
- [x] Test with different scenes
- [x] Improve the GUI for selecting the scene
- [x] FIGURE OUT WHY THE PERSPECTIVE CAMERA ASPECT RATIO BRICKS THE IMAGE
- [ ] Fix the contribution of each light in the path traced renderer with multi light sampling by using the probability of the randomly chosen light (given its weight)
