This project was developed for Visualização e Iluminação (Visualization and Lighting) class at Universidade do Minho. The main goal of this project is to implement a modular rendering engine in C++ following the teachings of the Physically Based Rendering: From theory to implementation book by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob and Greg Humphreys. This has been my most insightful project into the rendering world, where I've learned about the theory behind the rendering process of which I was already familiarized with most concepts due to previous experience in Blender.
