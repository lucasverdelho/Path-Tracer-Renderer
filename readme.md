# Path Tracer Renderer 

This project was developed for the *Visualização e Iluminação* (Visualization and Lighting) class at Universidade do Minho. The main goal is to implement a modular rendering engine in C++ based on the principles outlined in *Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation* by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys. Working on this project has deepened my understanding of rendering theory, building on my prior experience with Blender and introducing new technical insights.

## TODO
- [x] Clean up comments and rename variables for clarity
- [x] Fix orthogonal camera coordinate calculations (X-axis is inverted, likely due to sign issues)
- [x] Test with various scenes
- [x] Improve TUI for scene selection
- [x] Resolve aspect ratio issues in perspective camera rendering
- [ ] Adjust light contributions in path tracing for accurate multi-light sampling by incorporating light probability (based on weights)
